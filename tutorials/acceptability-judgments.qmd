## Problem Statement

We want to understand the relationship between a response variable `y`
and a predictor `x` using a simple, interpretable model.

## Data

We use a simulated dataset to focus on methodology rather than data collection.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
df <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(100),
  y = 2 + 3 * x + rnorm(100)
)
```
